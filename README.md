[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/bdougie/kaldi-auth-test)

### **Set up Auth0**
Create a free [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) account if you don't have one already. Follow all of the onboarding instructions, including creating a new application in whatever region you like.

Go to the "Clients" tab of the Auth0 dashboard and create a new client for a single page application.

Go to the Client tab and click on the connection you created previously. It should look like this:

You can setup a rule to make sure every created user will be assigned the role `user`.

```js
function (user, context, callback) {
  user.app_metadata = user.app_metadata || {};
  // You can add a Role based on what you want
  // In this case I check domain
  var addRolesToUser = function(user, cb) {
    if (user.email && user.email.indexOf('@example.com') > -1) {
      cb(null, ['admin']);
    } else {
      cb(null, ['user']);
    }
  };

  addRolesToUser(user, function(err, roles) {
    if (err) {
      callback(err);
    } else {
      user.app_metadata.authorization.roles = roles;
      auth0.users.updateAppMetadata(user.user_id, user.app_metadata)
        .then(function(){
          callback(null, user, context);
        })
        .catch(function(err){
          callback(err);
        });
    }
  });
}
```


**CMS**

Once the authentication is don is done, you can to setup the GitHub integration for Netlify CMS.

Go to https://github.com/settings/developers and register a new application.

Then go to the "Access" tab in your new Netlify site and add a GitHub authentication provider.

Once that's done, you'll be able to enter the CMS by going to the URL of your new site and appending `/admin`

## Local Development

Clone this repository, and run `yarn` or `npm install` from the new folder to install all required dependencies.

Then start the development server with `yarn start` or `npm start`.

## Layouts

The template is based on small, content-agnostic partials that can be mixed and matched. The pre-built pages showcase just a few of the possible combinations. Refer to the `site/layouts/partials` folder for all available partials.

Use Hugoâ€™s `dict` functionality to feed content into partials and avoid repeating yourself and creating discrepancies.

## CSS

The template uses a custom fork of Tachyons and PostCSS with cssnext and cssnano. To customize the template for your brand, refer to `src/css/imports/_variables.css` where most of the important global variables like colors and spacing are stored.

## SVG

All SVG icons stored in `site/static/img/icons` are automatically optimized with SVGO (gulp-svgmin) and concatenated into a single SVG sprite stored as a a partial called `svg.html`. Make sure you use consistent icons in terms of viewport and art direction for optimal results. Refer to an SVG via the `<use>` tag like so:

```
<svg width="16px" height="16px" class="db">
  <use xlink:href="#SVG-ID"></use>
</svg>
```
